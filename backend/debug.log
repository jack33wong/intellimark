# MARKING TASK: Question 10

## QUESTION TEXT
**[10]**: Venn diagram and probability.

**[10a]**: 100 people were asked whether they had visited France (F) or Spain (S). 55 had visited France. 60 had visited Spain. 4 had not visited either country. Complete the Venn diagram.

**[10bi]**: One of these 100 people is chosen at random. Write down the probability that this person had visited exactly one of the countries.

**[10bii]**: Write down the probability that this person had visited France given that they had also visited Spain.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[10a] [MAX SCORE: 3]
- B3: Fully correct diagram (36, 19, 41) [3 marks]
- B3: Fully correct diagram or
- B2: Any one of 36, 19, or 41 correctly placed 4 or
- B1: the total of $F=55$ or for the total of $S=60$ or $F\cap S^{\prime}+(F\cap S)+F^{\prime}\cap S=96$ Do not accept a blank region as 0, for any marks we need to see a number in each region

[10bi] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- M1: their $(36+41)$ or 77
- M1: $\frac{77}{100}$ or 0.77 or 77%

[10bii] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- B1: 0.19 ое ог or their60 k from their (a) and 0 < fraction < 1 (k is an integer)
- B1: $\frac{19}{60}$ or 0.316 to 0.317 or 0.32


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL QUALITY CHECK (DO NOT IGNORE):
1. **PARTIAL MATCH TRAP:** Did you match a number like "36" to a digit like "3"? -> STOP. Return UNMATCHED.
2. **LABEL TRAP:** Did you anchor to a label like "(a)", "(ii)", or "Q1"? -> STOP. Return UNMATCHED.
3. **MISSING DATA:** If the exact whole number is not in the list, use "UNMATCHED".

# MARKING TASK: Question 5

## QUESTION TEXT
**[5]**: Habib has two identical tins. He puts 600 grams of flour into one of the tins. The flour fills the tin completely. The density of the flour is $0.6~g/cm^{3}$. Habib puts 600 grams of salt into the other tin. The salt does not fill the tin completely. The volume of the space in the tin that is not filled with salt is $700~cm^{3}$. Work out the density of the salt. You must show all your working.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[5] [MAX SCORE: 4]
- P1: for process to find volume of tin eg $600 \div 0.6 (= 1000)$
- P1: for process to find volume of salt eg "1000" $- 700 (= 300)$
- P1: for a process to find density of the salt eg $600 \div$ "300" or $0.6 \times$ ("1000" $\div$ "300") or $600 \div$ [volume]
- A1: 2


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

# MARKING TASK: Question 7

## QUESTION TEXT
**[7]**: A paddling pool is in the shape of a cylinder. The pool has radius 100 cm. The pool has depth 30 cm. The pool is empty. It is then filled with water at a rate of $250~cm^{3}$ per second. Work out the number of minutes it takes to fill the pool completely. Give your answer correct to the nearest minute. You must show all your working.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[7] [MAX SCORE: 4]
- P1: for process to find volume, eg $\pi \times 100^2 \times 30 (= 300000\pi$ or 942477(.796...))
- P1: for process to find time in seconds, eg "942477(.796...)" $\div 250 (= 1200\pi$ or 3769(.911...)) or [volume] $\div 250$ or for converting rate to minutes, eg $250 \times 60 (= 15000)$
- P1: for complete process eg "3769(.911...)" $\div 60 (= 20\pi)$ or "942477(.796...)" $\div$ "15000" $(= 20\pi)$
- A1: for answer in the range 62 to 63


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.


## STUDENT WORK (STRUCTURED)
[ID: p0_q7_line_1] volume = \\pi x100^2 x 30 = 30000\\pi
[ID: p0_q7_line_2] time = \\frac{30000\\pi}{250}
[ID: p0_q7_line_3] = 120\\pi seconds
[ID: p0_q7_line_4] = 62.8 minute
[ID: p0_q7_line_5] 63


## PAGE ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
You MUST respect the page assignments provided below. The images passed to you correspond to these Image Index values (marked with "--- Image X ---" labels above the images):
- Sub-question 7: Image 0

Do NOT search for work on other pages for these sub-questions, even if you see a question header there. Focus ONLY on the assigned image.

 
## RAW OCR BLOCKS
Use these IDs to map the student's work. Match them yourself based on the Semantic Fidelity Rules.

## QUESTION TEXT
**[8]**: $a=\binom{3}{2}$ $b=\binom{-1}{4}$. On the grid below, draw and label the vector $2a+b$.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:

>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[8] [MAX SCORE: 3]
- M1: for $2 \times 3 + -1 (= 5)$ or $2 \times 2 + 4 (= 8)$ seen as a calculation or for $\binom{2 \times 3}{2 \times 2} + \binom{-1}{4}$ or for $\binom{5}{b}$ or $\binom{a}{8}$ or for $\binom{3}{2}$ drawn or $\binom{6}{4}$ drawn or $\binom{-1}{4}$ drawn
- M1: for $\binom{5}{8}$ or for $\binom{5}{8}$ drawn with no arrow or incorrect arrow or for $\binom{5}{b}$ drawn with arrow or $\binom{a}{8}$ drawn with arrow, where $b \ne 8$ and $a \ne 5$
- A1: Vector $\binom{5}{8}$ drawn


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.

# MARKING TASK: Question 9

## QUESTION TEXT
**[9]**: The diagram shows a cube and a square-based pyramid. [A cube with side length 6cm. A square-based pyramid with base side length 8cm and vertical height h cm.] The volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the pyramid. Work out the perpendicular height, h cm, of the pyramid.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[9] [MAX SCORE: 3]
- P1: for process to find volume of at least one of the cube or the pyramid, eg $6 \times 6 \times 6 (= 216)$ oe or $k \times 8 \times 8 \times h (= \frac{64}{3}h)$ oe
- P1: for process to form an equation, eg $6 \times 6 \times 6 = k \times 8 \times 8 \times h$ or "216" $= \frac{64}{3}h$ or for process to find h eg "216" $\div 8^2 \div k$
- A1: for 10.125 oe mixed number


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.


## STUDENT WORK (STRUCTURED)
[ID: p0_q9_line_1] 6^3 = 8^2 h \times \frac{1}{3}
[ID: p0_q9_line_2] h = \frac{81}{8}
[ID: p0_q9_line_3] \frac{81}{8}


## PAGE ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
You MUST respect the page assignments provided below. The images passed to you correspond to these Image Index values (marked with "--- Image X ---" labels above the images):
- Sub-question 9: Image 0

Do NOT search for work on other pages for these sub-questions, even if you see a question header there. Focus ONLY on the assigned image.

 
## RAW OCR BLOCKS
Use these IDs to map the student's work. Match them yourself based on the Semantic Fidelity Rules.

[p0_ocr_0]: "9 The diagram shows a cube and a square-based pyramid. [PRINTED_INSTRUCTION [Q9]]"
[p0_ocr_1]: "The volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the pyramid."
[p0_ocr_2]: "Work out the perpendicular height, hcm, of the pyramid."
[p0_ocr_3]: "b^{3}=8^{2} h \times 1 / 3"
[p0_ocr_4]: "h=\frac{81}{8}"
[p0_ocr_5]: "\frac{81}{8} \mathrm{~cm}"
[p0_ocr_6]: "10"

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL QUALITY CHECK (DO NOT IGNORE):
1. **PARTIAL MATCH TRAP:** Did you match a number like "36" to a digit like "3"? -> STOP. Return UNMATCHED.
2. **LABEL TRAP:** Did you anchor to a label like "(a)", "(ii)", or "Q1"? -> STOP. Return UNMATCHED.
3. **MISSING DATA:** If the exact whole number is not in the list, use "UNMATCHED".

# MARKING TASK: Question 10

## QUESTION TEXT
**[10]**: There are only red counters and yellow counters in bag A. number of red counters : number of yellow counters = 3 : 5. There are only green counters and blue counters in bag B. The number of counters in bag B is half the number of counters in bag A. Given that there are x red counters in bag A, use algebra to show that the total number of counters in bag A and bag B is 4x.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[10] [MAX SCORE: 3]

- M1: (dep) for method to find the total number of counters in bag B, eg $(x + \frac{5x}{3}) \div 2 (= \frac{4x}{3})$ or $\frac{8x}{3} \div 2 (= \frac{4x}{3})$ or $(3y + 5y) \div 2 (= 4y)$
- C1: for complete method showing that total number of counters in bag A and bag B is 4x, eg $\frac{8x}{3} + \frac{4x}{3} = 4x$ or $3y + 5y + 4y = 12y$ and $12y \div 3y \times x = 4x$


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.

# MARKING TASK: Question 11

## QUESTION TEXT
**[11a]**: Mina records the speeds, in mph, of some cars on a road on Friday. She uses her results to work out the information in this table. [Lowest speed: 25, Lower quartile: 35, Median: 40, Interquartile range: 12, Range: 37]. On the grid, draw a box plot to show the information in the table.

**[11b]**: Mina also records the speeds of some cars on the same road on Sunday. She uses her results to draw this box plot. [Box plot for Sunday is shown]. Compare the distribution of the speeds on Friday with the distribution of the speeds on Sunday.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[11a] [MAX SCORE: 3]
- M1: for method to find UQ (47) or greatest value (62) from the table
- M1: for showing a box and at least 3 correctly plotted values from 25, 35, 40, 47, 62
- A1: for a fully correct box plot

[11b] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- C1: ft a correct comparison of medians from figures, eg the median speed for Sunday was greater than the median speed for Friday or the speed on Friday is generally lower as the median is lower
- C1: ft for a correct comparison of spread, eg the (interquartile) range of the speeds for Friday is smaller than the (interquartile) range of the speeds for Sunday, the (interquartile) range on Sunday is larger than the (interquartile) range on Friday. Comparisons for this mark can relate to the range or the IQR


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.


## STUDENT WORK (STRUCTURED)

[SUB-QUESTION a]
[ID: p0_visual_drawing_11_2] [DRAWING]

[SUB-QUESTION b]

[ID: p0_q11_line_4] The ronge die is also higher on Sunday as
[ID: p0_q11_line_5] 44>37.


## PAGE ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
You MUST respect the page assignments provided below. The images passed to you correspond to these Image Index values (marked with "--- Image X ---" labels above the images):
- Sub-question 11: Image 0
- Sub-question 11a: Image 0

# MARKING TASK: Question 12

## QUESTION TEXT
**[12]**: The diagram shows triangle T drawn on a grid. [Triangle T vertices at (1,2), (1,3), (3,2)]. Enlarge triangle T by scale factor -2 with centre of enlargement (0,0).




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[12] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- B2: for correct enlargement (-2, -4), (-2, -6), (-6, -4)
- (B1: for correct size and orientation but incorrect position or 2 out of 3 vertices correctly placed)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

# MARKING TASK: Question 13

## QUESTION TEXT
**[13]**: There are 30 students in a class. A teacher is going to choose at random 2 of the students. Work out the number of different pairs of students that the teacher can choose.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[13] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- M1: for start to method of finding the number of pairs, eg $30 \times 29 (= 870)$ oe or $\frac{30 \times 29}{2}$ or clear intention to sum the integers from 1 to 29 eg $29 + 28 + ... + 2 + 1$
- A1: 435


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

# MARKING TASK: Question 14

## QUESTION TEXT
**[14]**: At the start of 2022 Kim invested some money in a savings account. The account paid 3.5% compound interest each year. At the end of 2022 interest was added to the account then Kim took £750 from the account. At the end of 2023 interest was added to the account then Kim took £1000 from the account. There was then £2937.14 in the account. Work out how much money Kim invested at the start of 2022. You must show all your working.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[14] [MAX SCORE: 4]
- P1: for start to processes needed to find the investment, eg $2937.14 + 1000 (= 3937.14)$ OR starts to work with algebra, eg $P \times 1.035 - 750$
- P1: for process to find amount of money at the beginning of 2023 after the first withdrawal, eg "3937.14" $\div 1.035 (= 3804)$ or $[value] \div 1.035$ OR writes down complete equation, eg $(P \times 1.035 - 750) \times 1.035 - 1000 = 2937.14$ to find $1.035P - 750$
- P1: for complete process, eg $("3804" + 750) \div 1.035$ OR for a start to the process to solve the equation eg $1.035P - 750 = 3804$ or $P \times 1.035 - 750 = \frac{2937.14 + 1000}{1.035}$ or for a start to the process to solve the complete equation eg $1.035^2P - 776.25 = 2937.14 + 1000$ or $1.035^2P - 1000 = 2937.14 + 776.25$ or $1.035^2P = 2937.14 + 776.25 + 1000$
- A1: 4400


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

# MARKING TASK: Question 16

## QUESTION TEXT
**[16]**: The functions f and g are given by $f(x)=\frac{12}{x+1}$ and $g(x)=5-3x$

**[16a]**: Find $f(-3)$

**[16b]**: Find $fg(1)$

**[16c]**: Find $g^{-1}(4)$




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[16a] [MAX SCORE: 1]
- B1: -6

[16b] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- M1: for $g(1) = 5 - 3 \times 1 (= 2)$ and a clear intention to find $f("2")$ or for $\frac{12}{5-3 \times 1+1}$ or for stating fg, eg $\frac{12}{5-3x+1}$ oe
- A1: 4

[16c] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- M1: for $g^{-1}$ as $\frac{5-x}{3}$ oe or for $5-3x=4$ or $g(\frac{1}{3}) = 5-1 = 4$
- A1: for $\frac{1}{3}$ oe eg 0.33(3...)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

# MARKING TASK: Question 18

## QUESTION TEXT
**[18]**: ABCD is a quadrilateral. [Triangle ABC with angle BAC = 35 degrees, Angle ACB = 48 degrees, side AB = 17cm. Triangle ACD attached to AC with angle CAD = 57 degrees]. The area of triangle ABC is $54~cm^{2}$. Calculate the area of triangle ACD. Give your answer correct to 3 significant figures.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[18] [MAX SCORE: 5]
- P1: for start of process to find length of AC, eg $\frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times AC \times \sin 35 = 54$ or $(AC = ) 54 \div (\frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times \sin 35) (\approx 11.076...)$
- P1: for start of process to find AD or CD, eg $\frac{AD}{\sin 48} = \frac{"11.076"}{\sin 57}$ or $\frac{AD}{\sin 48} = \frac{[AC]}{\sin 57}$ oe or $\frac{CD}{\sin "75"} = \frac{"11.076"}{\sin 57}$ or $\frac{CD}{\sin "75"} = \frac{[AC]}{\sin 57}$ oe
- P1: for complete process to find AD or CD $(AD=) \frac{"11.076"}{\sin 57} \times \sin 48 (= 9.81...)$ or $(AD=) \frac{[AC]}{\sin 57} \times \sin 48$ or $(CD=) \frac{"11.076"}{\sin 57} \times \sin "75" (= 12.7...)$ or $(CD=) \frac{[AC]}{\sin 57} \times \sin "75"
- P1: for process to find area of triangle ACD, $\frac{1}{2} \times "11.076" \times "12.7" \times \sin 48$ or $\frac{1}{2} \times [AC] \times [CD] \times \sin 48$ or $\frac{1}{2} \times "11.076" \times "9.81" \times \sin "75"$ or $\frac{1}{2} \times [AC] \times [AD] \times \sin "75"$ or $\frac{1}{2} \times "9.81" \times "12.7" \times \sin 57$ or $\frac{1}{2} \times [AD] \times [CD] \times \sin 57$
- A1: for answer in the range 52.4 to 52.52


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

# MARKING TASK: Question 19

## QUESTION TEXT
**[19]**: $R=\frac{P}{Q}$. $P=5.88\times10^{8}$ correct to 3 significant figures. $Q=3.6\times10^{5}$ correct to 2 significant figures. Work out the lower bound for R. Give your answer as an ordinary number correct to the nearest integer. You must show all your working.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[19] [MAX SCORE: 3]
- B1: for $5.875 \times 10^8$ or $5.885 \times 10^8$ or $3.55 \times 10^5$ or $3.65 \times 10^5$ or the digits 5875 or 5885 or 355 or 365
- M1: for method to find lower bound $\frac{[LB]}{[UB]}$ eg $(5.875 \times 10^8) \div (3.65 \times 10^5)$ oe
- A1: for answer in range 1609 - 1610 from correct working


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.


## STUDENT WORK (STRUCTURED)
[ID: p0_q19_line_1] LMB of P= 5.875x108, UB of Q = 365x10
[ID: p0_q19_line_2] R= \frac{5.8875x10^8}{3.65x105}
[ID: p0_q19_line_3] = 1609.59
[ID: p0_q19_line_4] 1610


## PAGE ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
You MUST respect the page assignments provided below. The images passed to you correspond to these Image Index values (marked with "--- Image X ---" labels above the images):
- Sub-question 19: Image 0

Do NOT search for work on other pages for these sub-questions, even if you see a question header there. Focus ONLY on the assigned image.

# MARKING TASK: Question 20

## QUESTION TEXT
**[20a]**: $x-4$, $x+2$ and $3x+1$ are three consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence. Find the value of x.

**[20b]**: $y-4$, $y+2$ and $3y+1$ are three consecutive terms of a geometric sequence. Find the possible values of y.




## MARKING SCHEME
> [INSTRUCTION]: You are the CHIEF EXAMINER.
> 1. **MATCH**: Match the student's work strictly to the M1/A1/B1 definitions below.
> 2. **STRICT SILO RULE (CRITICAL)**:
>    - You MUST respect the [MAX SCORE] for each sub-question.
>    - **OVERFLOW CHECK:** If you find 4 valid marks, but [6a] only allows 2, you MUST check if the other 2 marks belong to [6b].
>    - **DO NOT** lump all marks into the first bucket. Distribute them based on which sub-question they answer.

[OFFICIAL SCHEME]
[20a] [MAX SCORE: 2]
- P1: for process to find the common difference between the first and second and the common difference between the third and second term eg $(3x+1) - (x+2) (= 2x-1)$ and $(x+2) - (x-4) (= 6)$ or for process to write a correct equation in x, eg $(3x+1) - (x+2) = (x+2) - (x-4)$ or $2x-1 = 6$ oe
- A1: for 3.5 oe eg $\frac{7}{2}$

[20b] [MAX SCORE: 5]
- P1: for process to write a correct equation in terms of the common ratio and y eg $r(y-4) = y+2$ or $r(y+2) = 3y+1$
- P1: for process to write a correct equation in y eg $\frac{3y+1}{y+2} = \frac{y+2}{y-4}$ oe
- P1: for process to write a correct equation without fractions eg $(3y+1)(y-4) = (y+2)(y+2)$ oe
- P1: for process of writing a correct simplified equation eg $2y^2 - 15y - 8 (= 0)$
- A1: -0.5, 8


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

# MARKING TASK: Question 21

## QUESTION TEXT
**[21]**: The diagram shows a circle, radius r cm and two regular hexagons. [A larger hexagon ABCDEF circumscribes the circle (sides are tangents). A smaller hexagon PQRSTU is inscribed in the circle (sides are chords)]. Each side of the larger hexagon ABCDEF is a tangent to the circle. Each side of the smaller hexagon PQRSTU is a chord of the circle. By considering perimeters, show that $3 < \pi < 2\sqrt{3}$




## MARKING SCHEME

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of annotations you generate MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL to the number of marks available in the MARKING SCHEME.
> - If the marking scheme has 4 potential marks (e.g., M1, M1, A1, B1), you MUST return exactly 4 annotations.
> - Do NOT omit marks that were not awarded; return them as 0 (e.g., M0, A0) to ensure the count matches exactly.

## PAGE ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
You MUST respect the page assignments provided below. The images passed to you correspond to these Image Index values (marked with "--- Image X ---" labels above the images):
- Sub-question 21: Image 0

Do NOT search for work on other pages for these sub-questions, even if you see a question header there. Focus ONLY on the assigned image.

 
## RAW OCR BLOCKS
Use these IDs to map the student's work. Match them yourself based on the Semantic Fidelity Rules.

[p0_ocr_0]: "21 The diagram shows a circle, radius \( r \mathrm{~cm} \) and two regular hexagons. [PRINTED_INSTRUCTION [Q21]]"
[p0_ocr_1]: "Each side of the larger hexagon \( A B C D E F \) is a tangent to the circle."

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL QUALITY CHECK (DO NOT IGNORE):
1. **PARTIAL MATCH TRAP:** Did you match a number like "36" to a digit like "3"? -> STOP. Return UNMATCHED.
2. **LABEL TRAP:** Did you anchor to a label like "(a)", "(ii)", or "Q1"? -> STOP. Return UNMATCHED.
3. **MISSING DATA:** If the exact whole number is not in the list, use "UNMATCHED".
