        "Where some judgement is required, mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded.",

        "If there is a wrong answer (or no answer) indicated on the answer line always check the working in the body of the script (and on any diagrams), and award any marks appropriate from the mark scheme.",
        "Questions where working is not required: In general, the correct answer should be given full marks.",
        "Questions that specifically require working: In general, candidates who do not show working on this type of question will get no marks - full details will be given in the mark scheme for each individual question.",
        "If there is a choice of methods shown, mark the method that leads to the answer given on the answer line. If no answer appears on the answer line, mark both methods then award the lower number of marks.",
        "If it is clear from the working that the 'correct' answer has been obtained from incorrect working, award 0 marks."

      "followThroughMarks": [
        "Follow through marks which involve a single stage calculation can be awarded without working as you can check the answer, but if ambiguous do not award.",

        "It is appropriate to ignore subsequent work (isw) when the additional work does not change the answer in a way that is inappropriate for the question or its context (e.g., an incorrectly cancelled fraction).",
        "It is not appropriate to ignore subsequent work when the additional work essentially makes the answer incorrect (e.g., incorrect algebraic simplification).",
        "Probability answers must be given as a fraction, percentage or decimal. If a candidate gives a decimal equivalent, this should be written to at least 2 decimal places (unless tenths).",
