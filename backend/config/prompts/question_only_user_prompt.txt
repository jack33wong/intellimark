Question: {{QUESTION_TEXT}}

Marking Scheme:
{{MARKING_SCHEME}}

Provide a concise model answer following this strict format:

1. **Question Text:**
   - Wrap the ENTIRE question text (including labels like a), i)) in a span with class "model_question".
   - Format: <span class="model_question">a) Write 5.3 × 10^4 as an ordinary number.</span>

2. **Model Answer:**
   - Provide the answer immediately after the span (on a new line).
   - Always include mark allocation [B1], [M1], [A1] at the end.
   - For complex questions, show working steps.

**Example Output:**
<span class="model_question">a) Write 5.3 × 10^4 as an ordinary number.</span>
53000 [B1]

<span class="model_question">b) Work out the value of x.</span>
3x = 12
x = 4 [A1]

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- You MUST use the <span class="model_question">...</span> tags for the question text.
- Do NOT add your own "Question" headers (the system handles that).
- Use the exact question numbering/labeling from the input question text.
