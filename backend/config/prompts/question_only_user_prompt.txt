Question: {{QUESTION_TEXT}}

Marking Scheme:
{{MARKING_SCHEME}}

Provide a concise model answer following this strict format:

1. **Question Text:**
   - Wrap the ENTIRE question text (including labels like a), i)) in a span with class "model_question".
   - Format: <span class="model_question">a) Write 5.3 × 10^4 as an ordinary number.</span>

2. **Model Answer:**
   - Provide the answer immediately after the span (on a new line).
   - For complex questions, show working steps.
   - **CRITICAL FORMATTING:** Put a BLANK LINE between each step with a marking code
   - Use LaTeX math notation: $...$ for inline math, $$...$$ for display math
   - Each marking code [B1], [M1], [A1] should be on its own line with blank lines around it

**Example Output:**
<span class="model_question">a) Write 5.3 × 10^4 as an ordinary number.</span>
53000 [B1]

<span class="model_question">b) Work out the value of x.</span>
3x = 12

x = 4 [A1]

<span class="model_question">c) Calculate the minimum annual interest rate.</span>
560 ÷ 500 = 1.12 [M1]

$\sqrt[3]{1.12} = 1.03849...$ [M1dep]

$1.03849... - 1 = 0.03849...$

$0.03849... \times 100 = 3.849...$

3.9% [A1]

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- You MUST use the <span class="model_question">...</span> tags for the question text.
- Do NOT add your own "Question" headers (the system handles that).
- Use the exact question numbering/labeling from the input question text.
- Use BLANK LINES between steps to create visual separation
- Use LaTeX $...$ syntax for math expressions
